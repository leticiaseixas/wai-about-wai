## About the Project
{:#about}

WAI-CooP, Communities of Practice, is a Coordination and Support Action project, co-funded by the European Commission (EC) under the Horizon 2020 program (Grant Agreement 101004794). The project is schedule to start on 1 January 2021 for a duration of three years. WAI-CooP support implementation of the international standards for digital accessibility through:

-   Establishing vendor-neutral overview on available training, tools, and resources internationally
-   Analyzing technological advancements and coordinating with relevant research and development
-   Providing opportunities for key stakeholders to share resources and to exchange best practices

WAI-CooP achieves this by building on the existing wealth of authoritative guidance available from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), to provide a one-stop shop for the broad spectrum of key stakeholders involved in the implementation of digital accessibility. This includes public bodies and private entities; organisations representing people with disabilities; product, service, and training providers; researchers; and policy makers.
